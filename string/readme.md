# KMP Algorithm
- skipping mismatch
# Boyerâ€“Moore string-search algorithm
- skipping mismatch
# Rabin-Karp Algorithm (Checking same substr)
- Based Rolling hash
- Expected = O(n); worst = O(n^2)
- 1. By computing the hash value
- 2. If match, perform a full comparison at that position
- Simple hash funtion: mod by a big prime => by number theory the reduced residual system is p - 1
