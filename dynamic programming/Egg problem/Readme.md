Start with thinking the simpliest case 1.
Then, think about case 2. 
- You will start finding some observations
- The observations here is that best strategy make broken and not broken use the same number of throw => A optimum between broken and not broken

# Thus, we can use this deduce that fact that global maximum = all sub optimum
