# Algorithm
Search(array, target, low, high)
- Conditions: 
  - low + 1 == high: check both items and return
  - low > high: false
  - target == mid: return
- Search left: Search(array, target, low, mid)
- Search right: Search(array, target, mid, high)

# Comments/ Ideas
A part consist from monotonic structure could use Binary Search to search some value

# iterative methods 
Search(arr, target):
left = 0 
right = size() - 1
while (left <= right):
  mid = (left + right) >> 1;
  if inside left:
    right = mid - 1;
  else if inside right:
    left = mid + 1;
  else found/ not found:
    return mid;
