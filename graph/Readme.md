# Euler Circuit
### Algorithm
- while graph[current] not empty()
-- get one and delete one 
-- recursion
-- add new node
### Definition
- Each edge go once and only once
### Existence 
- All in == out
- All in == out, except one in = out + 1 and one out = in + 1
# Hamilton Circuit
### Definition
- Each vertex go once and only once
