# Leetcode-Practice

A record for github practice

### cpp concept
- Unordered_set cannot work with vector<int>, but set can
- const auto& it = set.find(xxx);
- if (it != set.end()) set.erase(it);

### If know size
Use array much faster than vector

### Use template algorithm for competitive programming

### If much branch, try to draw it out

### Think about set or multiset

### always use long long for hard question &&& Use long long with LLONG_MAX
